# Comp-Advanced-Machine-Learning

In contrast to other units focussing on foundations or applications of machine learning, this unit focusses on theoretical underpinnings of machine learning, and deep learning in particular, and the advanced techniques in machine learning that come from understanding them.  The unit covers the theoretical properties of various kinds of machine learning approaches, and advanced techniques like autoencoders, representation learning, Generative Adversarial Networks and deep generative models.
